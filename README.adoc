= Plurimath Parslet

This is a fork of the original Parslet gem, which is a parser library for Ruby.

This differs from the original Parslet gem, such that it is Opal (JS based Ruby)
compatible.

== Introduction

Parslet makes developing complex parsers easy. It does so by:

* providing the best error reporting possible
* not generating reams of code for you to debug

Parslet takes the long way around to make your job easier. It allows for
incremental language construction. Often, you start out small, implementing
the atoms of your language first; _parslet_ takes pride in making this
possible.

== Synopsis

[source,ruby]
----
require 'parslet'
include Parslet

# parslet parses strings
str('foo').
  parse('foo') # => "foo"@0

# it matches character sets
match['abc'].parse('a') # => "a"@0
match['abc'].parse('b') # => "b"@0
match['abc'].parse('c') # => "c"@0

# and it annotates its output
str('foo').as(:important_bit).
  parse('foo') # => {:important_bit=>"foo"@0}

# you can construct parsers with just a few lines
quote = str('"')
simple_string = quote >> (quote.absent? >> any).repeat >> quote

simple_string.
  parse('"Simple Simple Simple"') # => "\"Simple Simple Simple\""@0

# or by making a fuss about it
class Smalltalk < Parslet::Parser
  root :smalltalk

  rule(:smalltalk) { statements }
  rule(:statements) {
    # insert smalltalk parser here (outside of the scope of this readme)
  }
end

# and then
Smalltalk.new.parse('smalltalk')
----

== Features

* Tools for every part of the parser chain
* Transformers generate Abstract Syntax Trees
* Accelerators transform parsers, making them quite a bit faster
* Pluggable error reporters
* Graphviz export for your parser
* Rspec testing support rig
* Simply Ruby, composable and hackable

== Compatibility

This library is intended to work with Ruby variants >= 2.7. It has been tested on:

* MRI Ruby 2.7+
* JRuby
* Opal (works as Ruby 3.2, with the limitation of `StringScanner#charpos` not being
  available, which is used in some examples)

Please report as a bug if you encounter issues.

== Status

Production worthy.

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'plurimath-parslet'
----

And then execute:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install plurimath-parslet
----

== Usage

[source,ruby]
----
require 'parslet'
----

The gem maintains the original `parslet` namespace for compatibility.

== Examples

The `examples/` directory contains 25 interactive examples that demonstrate various parsing scenarios and techniques. These examples are designed to help you learn parslet by showing real-world parsing problems and their solutions.

=== How to run examples

Each example can be run directly from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby examples/run_boolean_algebra.rb
$ ruby examples/run_json.rb
$ ruby examples/run_calc.rb
----

=== Example structure

Each example follows a consistent structure:

* Educational comments explaining the parsing problem
* Sample input data demonstrating various test cases
* Parser demonstration showing both successful parsing and error handling
* Output explanation describing what the parser supports and how it works

=== Learning path

For beginners, we recommend starting with these examples in order:

. `run_simple_xml.rb` - Basic parsing concepts
. `run_calc.rb` - Operator precedence and evaluation
. `run_json.rb` - Complex data structures
. `run_boolean_algebra.rb` - Transformations and logic
. `run_minilisp.rb` - Advanced parsing techniques

== Development

After checking out the repo, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
----

=== Available rake tasks

==== Testing

* `rake spec` - Run all tests (438 examples covering all functionality)
* `rake spec:unit` - Run unit tests only
* `rake spec:opal` - Run Opal (JavaScript) tests (437 examples)

===== Running Opal tests

The Opal test suite runs the same specs as the Ruby test suite but in a
JavaScript environment via Node.js. This ensures parslet works correctly when
compiled to JavaScript with Opal.

To run all Opal tests:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle exec rake spec:opal
----

The Opal specs are located in the `spec-opal/` directory and mirror the
structure of the main `spec/` directory.

NOTE: Some Opal tests may fail due to environment differences between Ruby and
JavaScript execution, but the core parsing functionality is fully supported.

==== Benchmarking

* `rake benchmark` - Run quick benchmarks (alias for benchmark:quick)
* `rake benchmark:quick` - Run example-focused benchmarks only
* `rake benchmark:examples` - Run example-focused benchmarks
* `rake benchmark:all` - Run comprehensive benchmark suite (all categories)
* `rake benchmark:export` - Run benchmarks and export results to JSON/YAML files

===== What gets benchmarked

The benchmark suite measures parsing performance across different scenarios:

**Basic Parsing Operations**

* `str('hello')` - Simple string matching performance
* `match('[a-z]').repeat(1)` - Character class matching with repetition
* Email-like pattern matching - Complex regex-style parsing (`user@example.com`)

**Calculator Parser** (from `example/calc.rb`)

* Simple expressions: `1+2`
* Medium complexity: `1+2*3-4/2`
* Complex expressions: `123*456+789-321/3*2+1`
* Full pipeline (parse + transform + evaluate)

**JSON Parser** (from `example/json.rb`)

* Simple objects: `{"key": "value"}`
* Arrays: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
* Complex nested structures with multiple data types
* Parse vs. transform performance comparison

**String Parsing**

* Simple quoted strings: `"hello world"`
* Long strings (1000+ characters)
* Escaped strings with backslash sequences: `"hello \"world\" with escapes"`

**Repetition Patterns**

* `repeat(1)` with varying input lengths (short/medium/long)
* Bounded repetition `repeat(3,6)`
* Optional repetition `repeat` (zero or more)
* Performance scaling with input size

**Transform Operations**

* Simple AST transformations (number/string conversion)
* Medium complexity (multiple rules, arrays)
* Complex nested transformations with multiple rule types
